Translates from latin to: __method of putting by placing__ or in other words, _implication elimination_. Which means that the value of the _condition_ ($P$), implies the value of the _outcome_. Therefore, _if the condition is true, the outcome is also true_. 

```python
if P == True:
	Q = True

# Therefore:

P + True -> Q = True
```
